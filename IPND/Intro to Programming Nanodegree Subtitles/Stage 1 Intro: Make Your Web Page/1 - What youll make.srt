0:00:00.410,0:00:03.273
This is the first stage of the project[br]you'll be working on throughout this

0:00:03.273,0:00:04.059
Nanodegree.

0:00:04.059,0:00:07.860
And that project is a web page which[br]you're going to build from scratch

0:00:07.860,0:00:11.140
to store your notes as you[br]go through this Nanodegree.

0:00:11.140,0:00:14.820
Now initially, this web page isn't going[br]to be very impressive, and that's okay.

0:00:14.820,0:00:16.980
Because as you develop as a programmer,

0:00:16.980,0:00:18.990
your web page is going to[br]improve along with you
