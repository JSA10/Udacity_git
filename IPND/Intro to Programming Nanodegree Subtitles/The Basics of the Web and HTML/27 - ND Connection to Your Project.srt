Let's connect what you've learnt about the Web and  HTML, back to the project you're going to be working on, your Web page.  And to that, let's take a look at the project I built.  In this page if you go to the Codepens section, down here in this HTML and  CSS Core Concepts, you'll see a vs Demo,  which may be helpful at this point.  And if we open that up, well, we can close the CSS and JavaScript,  we don't need that yet.  You'll see, I've sort of demonstrated what Steve went through just recently.  You can see the a elements are in line elements,  because they don't take up their whole line.  Where as p elements are block.  This one shows up here, and this one shows up down here.  We can also go back up a little more.  And this Stage 0 section, that's exactly what you're about to be working on now,  so of course you can click edit and see how I did mine.  What you do will certainly be different, but this is good for  inspiration and using other people's code to remember how to do something  or to learn something that's possible that you didn't know about before  is always a good idea.  So now, you should go ahead and make your own Stage 0 project.  Write your notes, put them in the appropriate elements, and  when you're happy, submit your project.  Don't worry about getting everything perfect, it's more important  that you get the feedback that will come shortly after you submit.  And in fact, the whole purpose of this submission process is to get feedback.  And shortly after you complete this Stage 0, you'll complete another lesson  and your code will look like what we could see here.  Then one lesson later,  you will have a webpage that looks significantly more engaging.  The colors will be nicer, you will be able to choose your fonts,  indentation will look better and all of this will be because of the CSS styling  that you'll have applied to your HTML structure.  I just want to show you that so you know where you're going.  For now, stay focused on this Stage 0.
