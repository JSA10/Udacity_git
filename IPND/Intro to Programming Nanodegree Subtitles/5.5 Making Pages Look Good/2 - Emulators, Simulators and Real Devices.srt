Throughout this course,

0:00:01.230,0:00:04.480
you're going to need to test[br]your site on different devices.

0:00:04.480,0:00:06.470
So, pull out your credit card and

0:00:06.470,0:00:09.735
get ready to order all of these[br]devices that you see behind you.

0:00:09.735,0:00:14.305
>> [LAUGH] Pete, I, I don't think[br]we can ask everybody to do that.

0:00:14.305,0:00:15.145
>> Fair enough.

0:00:15.145,0:00:18.865
Instead, you could just use[br]a simulator or emulators.

0:00:18.865,0:00:21.425
Simulators and[br]emulators are great tools.

0:00:21.425,0:00:25.035
While they're not always 100% accurate,[br]because they're on different hardware

0:00:25.035,0:00:28.745
and sometimes have a different code[br]path, they'll often get the job done.

0:00:28.745,0:00:30.445
And for this course, we'll be just fine.

0:00:31.480,0:00:35.930
In this course, Cam and I are going to[br]use an emulator built into Chrome, but

0:00:35.930,0:00:39.530
be sure to check out some of the other[br]ones including the iOS simulator, and

0:00:39.530,0:00:42.640
some of the cloud based services[br]in the instructor notes.

0:00:42.640,0:00:44.280
>> Nice, I like that a lot more,

0:00:44.280,0:00:47.170
emulation is definitely[br]the much cheaper solution.

0:00:47.170,0:00:49.340
>> It is,[br]here lemme show you how it works.
