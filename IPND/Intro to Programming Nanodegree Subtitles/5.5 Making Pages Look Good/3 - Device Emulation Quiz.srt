Let's emulate a custom device.

0:00:02.870,0:00:07.970
It should have the following[br]characteristics, a width of 412 pixels,

0:00:07.970,0:00:13.330
a height of 603 pixels,[br]a device pixel ratio of 3.5, and

0:00:13.330,0:00:15.930
then the user agent[br]string should be this.

0:00:15.930,0:00:18.850
You'll find a copy of it[br]in the instructor notes.

0:00:18.850,0:00:21.110
When you open the URL in[br]the instructor notes,

0:00:21.110,0:00:24.010
you'll see a website that looks[br]a little something like this.

0:00:24.010,0:00:27.780
Pop open Dev tools, and[br]then go ahead and start Emulation mode.

0:00:27.780,0:00:29.900
When you've successfully[br]emulated the device,

0:00:29.900,0:00:32.980
you'll see a code appear[br]somewhere on this website.

0:00:32.980,0:00:34.890
Type your code into[br]this box to continue.
