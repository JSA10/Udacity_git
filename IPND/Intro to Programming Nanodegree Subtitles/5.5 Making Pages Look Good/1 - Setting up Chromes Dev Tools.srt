0:00:00.770,0:00:03.140
I'll open up Chrome Dev tools emulator,[br]and

0:00:03.140,0:00:06.520
look at a mobile view of[br]the web fundamentals site.

0:00:06.520,0:00:09.430
I'll open Chrome,[br]navigate to Web Fundamentals,

0:00:09.430,0:00:14.990
then open the Chrome Developer Tools,[br]using Cmd, Option J, or Control ALT+J.

0:00:14.990,0:00:17.460
Next, I'll hit the emulator button.

0:00:17.460,0:00:20.600
It's that phone looking[br]icon in the toolbar.

0:00:20.600,0:00:22.900
Great, the emulator is ready to go.

0:00:22.900,0:00:25.710
I can start loading pages and[br]see how they look.

0:00:25.710,0:00:26.870
But before I do,

0:00:26.870,0:00:30.990
I like to dock the tools to the right[br]side of the browser window.

0:00:30.990,0:00:33.420
Since most phones[br]are viewed in portrait,

0:00:33.420,0:00:37.820
docking to the right side gives me[br]the most amount of vertical space.

0:00:37.820,0:00:42.110
The other thing I need to do is pick[br]the device that I want to emulate.

0:00:42.110,0:00:46.240
Chrome has a bunch of predefined[br]devices, that I can choose from.

0:00:46.240,0:00:50.510
It auto-magically sets the view[br]port size, the user agent string,

0:00:50.510,0:00:54.795
device pixel ratio, and[br]enables touch emulation.

0:00:54.795,0:00:57.735
If you're not familiar with some[br]of these terms, don't worry.

0:00:57.735,0:01:00.095
We'll cover them as part of this course.

0:01:00.095,0:01:03.825
Now I can see how a page renders[br]across different devices without ever

0:01:03.825,0:01:04.385
leaving Chrome.

0:01:05.690,0:01:08.870
Sweet, that looks about[br]how I'd expect it.

0:01:08.870,0:01:11.420
Chrome has several other[br]things that it can emulate for

0:01:11.420,0:01:13.320
you in the Emulation panel.

0:01:13.320,0:01:14.950
Hit Escape to bring it up.

0:01:14.950,0:01:18.490
Why don't you go check out a few sites[br]with different emulated devices and

0:01:18.490,0:01:20.120
see how they behave?

0:01:20.120,0:01:23.110
And, don't forget to check out some of[br]the other things that you can emulate

0:01:23.110,0:01:23.650
while you're there.
