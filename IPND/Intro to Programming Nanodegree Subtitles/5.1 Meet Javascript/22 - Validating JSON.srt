So, I've opened up jsonlint.com which will tell us whether or  not this JSON is in the right format.  Go ahead and copy this object in just using the curly braces.  I don't need to copy var education.  Paste it in and click Validate.  And scrolling down we can see that this is, in face, a valid JSON.   Like what if we erase this comma, right here?  the error is, which is a big help.  Let's see, I'll come over here, I'll delete this comma, and click Validate.  And we can see that there's an error on Line 11 because we forgot the comma  that comes before it.  The good news is that text editors like Sublime Text also highlight errors and  help us figure out where our syntax went wrong.
