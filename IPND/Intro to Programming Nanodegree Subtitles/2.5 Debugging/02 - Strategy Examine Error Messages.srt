Sometimes it's really obvious that code has a bug because the bug makes the code  crash.  And when it crashes it usually gives some kind of error message.  Error messages can be confusing, but they do give some kind of information  besides just, it didn't work, try something different.  Specifically, when Python code crashes,  the message it gives is called a Traceback.  The Traceback tells you what line it crashed on, what file it was running,  and how it got there.  The information the Traceback gives you, especially the line number and  function name,  can focus your attention on the part of the code that might be going wrong.  Even if the root of that problem isn't on that exact line,  it's somewhere upstream of that line.  In this case, line number 5 is doing something that doesn't work,  trying to add a number and a string.  And we can look up the error message to find out what to do about it.  In this case, if we look up unsupported operand type(s) for  +: int, str, how about you try it.  Look this error message up on your favorite search engine, and  see if you can find a solution.
