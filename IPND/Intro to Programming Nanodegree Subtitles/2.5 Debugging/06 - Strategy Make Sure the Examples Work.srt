When you're working from example code,  though, you do have to exercise some care, or you could inherit bugs from it.  Like, let's say that we want to print out some text with a box around it.  We see that separator calls bar with a number  to make a plaintext horizontal line.  So it seems like we could use that to draw some horizontal lines of our own.  So we'll put a corner and then a bar of length equal to the length of the text,  and then another corner, and then we will put the text inside some vertical  lines then we will put another bar.  This looks like it should work.  Hm, well if that doesn't work, what then?  Maybe we need to look more closely in what these functions  that we're working with do.  Sometimes the example code you're working with didn't actually  work very well.  In that case, basing your own code on it never would have worked.  Maybe you can find out why it didn't.  Or else, find a better example.  So let's test out the bar function.  Ah-ha, bar is returning none.  So in this case, the bar function would be a lot more useful if  it returned the string instead of printing it.  That would let us use it effectively in our box function, like so.  So now you've seen both sides of working from example code.  When it's good it can be very, very good, but when it's bad it's annoying.
