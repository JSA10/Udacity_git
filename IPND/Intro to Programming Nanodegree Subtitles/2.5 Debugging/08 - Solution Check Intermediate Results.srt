So, here I've added some print statements, and we can see what's going  on inside this function when it gives us these weird results.  Hm, location -1.  That looks kind of odd.  So when the find method doesn't find sub inside some string,  like do isn't inside ding, it returns -1, but then reusing that  value as if it were an actual location in the string, down here.  Looking at these variables shows us that.  Now, really what we should do is if find doesn't find anything,  we could return some string unchanged.  Now that we've found the bug, we should remove the print statements we added.  That's one thing you have to be careful with when you use print statements  for debugging.  If you don't take them all out,  your code will print debugging information when you don't want it to.
