Oh, hey!  Look at that.  When I typed in this function definition,  I left off the colon at the end of the def line.  That's not going to work.  I actually do that all the time.  When I really copied and  pasted it though, the working version didn't have that bug.  It's important not just to get it working and stop there, but  to go back and find out where your original version went wrong so  you can improve your skills.
