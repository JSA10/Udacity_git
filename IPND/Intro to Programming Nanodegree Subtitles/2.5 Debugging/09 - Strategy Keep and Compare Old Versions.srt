If you have something almost, but not quite working and  your getting frustrated with it.  It can be tempting to throw it away and try again.  But sometimes your really close on your first try and  the second try isn't as close.  Then you want to be able to get back to the first version.  For short functions you can make this easier by commenting out  the old version.  In Python just put a hash mark before each line of the function.  Or you can turn it into a big string by putting triple quotes around it.  Now text editors do have an undo feature, but it doesn't usually let you  go back between multiple different versions of your code.  So it's not really good enough to let you compare different versions of code.  Undo is good for when you accidentally mess something up and  immediately notice.  But, you can't rely on undo alone to compare different versions of code or  to get back to an arbitrary version you previously had.  You can copy code into a different file.  Files aren't exactly expensive, after all.  Just make sure you save them where you can find them.  Another reason to keep old versions is that when you do ask for  help, you can show two or three different things you've tried.  Software engineers use version control systems like Git, which are pretty much  super powerful undo systems that let you navigate to any version of the code that  have multiple modified versions and share different versions and so on.  So keeping old versions isn't just for beginners.  It's how software engineering really works
