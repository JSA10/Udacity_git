We have our basic response status line, and  just like the request, the status line is followed by a number of headers.  I'll give you a few examples.  Here are some headers that are commonly included with HTTP responses.  Now, just like the client request,  the headers that you see aren't always the same.  Some of them are required.  And when I say required, I mean usually there.  But the web has evolved organically over time, so many of the headers that  are required are often not there, or things will work without them.  But anyway, okay.  So Date is there all the time, that's when the request happened.  No surprise there.  Server, this is similar to the User Agent header on the request.  This is the, generally the name and  version number of the server that's handling the response.  Now, personally, I try to never include this.  Or if I do include it, I make something up.  Because otherwise, you're just giving free information to  a would-be hacker who wants to know what vulnerabilities work against you.  Content- Type, very popular.  This is the type of document that's being returned, this is so  your browser knows how to display it.  So text/html is a common one, obviously.  That's what an HTML page would be.  You could see image/png, or image/gif if it's an image, that sort of thing.  Your Content- Length is how long the document that follows is.  Content- Length is often included but  it's not strictly required because the browser will know when that  document's done receiving data because the connection may close.  There's other ways of also telling the browser that I'm done sending data, but  it's not super relevant right this second.
