So, to get our outputs in the correct range,  we're going to use the Modulus Operator.  And, this is written with a percent sign.  It's usually the Shift>5 on those keyboards.  What Modulus does is takes a number and  maps it to the range, based on the remainder when you divide that number.  So, the way modulo arithmetic works is like a clock.  So, if we think of having a clock with 12 hours and  then arithmetic on the clock is modulo 12.  So, if we were to evaluate 14 modulo 12,  what that would mean is if we start from zero, and  we make 14 steps, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,   Where we end up is 2.  That's the same as the remainder we would get by dividing 14 by 12.  And, that's the result of 14 modulo 12, is 2.
