Okay, and now that we've tested our application, we're going to create  a project on Google App Engine so that we can deploy our application and  share that URL with our friends, family and anyone else.  I'm back in the tutorial page.  I'm going to scroll up and click on step nine, Uploading Your Application.  It's on the left-hand side of the screen right here.  Okay, now we are going to follow the instructions to  upload our application and deploy it live.  First, it says we need to sign in to App Engine using your Google account or  if you don't have one, create a Google account now.  Let's go ahead and click on the Visit the Google Developers console link.  And that'll take us to the sign in page.  I'm going to input my password.  Then I'm going to click sign in, and there we are.  I'm on my app engine page and I haven't created a project yet.  So let's get started.  Let's click on Create Project.  Now it gives us a couple options, first is the project name and  second is the project ID.  The project ID is going to be a unique ID across all of Google.  No one else can use that same ID.  Think of it as a username for any site you're going to use.  It needs to be unique.  Your project name, on the other hand,  is something just personal to you, whatever you want to call it.  Since this is our first google App Engine project,  I'm going to call mine First Project.  Now we can select a project ID here.  You can put anything you like but Google will auto-generate one for you.  I'm just going to use the one they gave us, clean-utility-88718.  And I'll go ahead and create this project.  Okay, now that we've created our project we're going to go ahead and  highlight our project ID and copy it.  I'm going to hit Ctrl+C, Cmd+C for all you Mac users out there, and  then I am going to switch back to Sublime.  Okay, I am back in Sublime now, before we didn't have any application ID  inputted, but we were still able to run it locally.  If you want to deploy your application, run it online and  share that link with someone else, you're going to need to input your  application ID you just created with your project.  I'm going to highlight your-app-id.  And then I'm going to paste in the application ID we just copied.  To do that on Windows, I'm going to hit Ctrl+V, on Mac, it's Cmd+V.  Okay, now let's go ahead and save.  Great! Now we are ready to deploy our  application.
