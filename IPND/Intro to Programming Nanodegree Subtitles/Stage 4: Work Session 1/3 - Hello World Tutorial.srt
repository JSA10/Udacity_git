Okay so now that we have Google App Engine installed,  let's run a tutorial just to get a hang of using the program.  So back in the window we were in, we'll click on Python and  then you will see Python tutorial and  then you will scroll down a little and you will see Hello, World.  We'll click on that and  we'll see some steps from Google, on how to run this tutorial.  So first it says to create a directory called Hello, World.  We can go to our desktop and create a new folder.  And let's call it helloworld.  Okay, so now that we have a folder created, we can move onto the next step.  So it says, that we want to create a file called helloworld.pi and  give it the following contents.  So let's select this, copy it, and then we can paste it here.  You'll notice that this is still formatted as a plain text file, so  we can go to file, save as, And  we want to choose the folder that we created on our desktop.  And it says to name the file helloworld.pi so we'll do that now.  Okay, so now you can see the file is reformatted as a python file.  Seen here.  And now let's move on to the next steps.  Okay, so now we have to create a .yaml file.  So again, we'll copy this text.  Copy it.  And then paste it in our sub line.  Once again,we'll save as and then this time we'll call it app.yaml.  Great, so now that we have this on our computer, we're ready for the next step.
