So we have clicked Andy provided us, and  we're not at the Google App Engine download page.  Let's go ahead and click on Google App Engine for  Python since that's the programming language we will be using.  Look like it opens the window a little bit, so we're going to scroll down.  And then we're going to choose the operating system for our computer.  I'm using a Windows computer, so I'm going to go ahead and  click on the Windows download link.  And we're going to want to keep that, and  as you can see in the bottom left-hand corner, the download has begun.  Let's actually scroll down and click on installing on Windows.  So it looks like it gives us some additional instructions, first we're  going to want to click on the link we just downloaded once it's finished.  And two, we're going to need Python installed on the computer  to use Google App Engine.  Since you already have Python installed, we're good to go.  Let's go ahead and click on that download file, and  then we're going to go ahead and run it.  Okay, we are at the installation instructions.  We're just going to follow all the instructions they have, click Next.  A short license that we're going to read.  going to want to accept the returns of the license agreement.  Continue forward.  Okay this page is going to tell us where we're going to install  Google App Engine.  It's going to create Start Menu shortcuts, a Desktop shortcut, and  add your path to the user path.  That just lets Google App Engine know where you're installed.  Now, let's stick with the default settings.  Click Next, and then we're ready to install.  We click on Install and we'll wait while it completes the installation.  We're going to click on Yes,  we do want to allow the following program to install.  So I allowed Google App Engine to be installed on my computer.  Make sure to do that, too, if you get a pop-up, asking for permission.  Okay, it looks like the installation has finished.  Let's go ahead and  run the launcher just to double check that everything worked out.  So great, it looks like we've downloaded and installed Google App Engine and  ran it successfully.  Let's move on.
