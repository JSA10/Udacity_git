Now we just walked you through how to create an application  on Google app engine.  You might have ran into some issues.  If you don't have a working projet at this time, no worries at all.  We're going to show you a short cut that lets you create an app engine  application that you can use yourself.  We're back in Google app engine launcher,  let's click on file, then create new application.  What this is going to do is it's going to set up all the folders and  files and make sure everything works correctly.  We can call it whatever we want but for now let's just use Engine App.  I'm going to select browse to pick where I want this saved and  I'm just going to save it on the desktop.  So I'm going to click the desktop, click OK, and we're ready to go.  Let's click create, now you can see another application  in the Google App Engine Launcher, Engine App.  Let's go ahead and run it locally, now that it's running, let's view it in  the browser by clicking browse and look at that, it says hello world.  Okay, so we're running our application locally.  Let's confirm that it was actually created.  What I'm going to do is I'm going to open up the desktop, and  as you can see, the engine app folder was created.  Let's open it, and we have main.pie, we have app.yamel and  a couple of other files that Google App Engine created for us.  We only have to worry about main.pie, and app.yamel for  now so let's open them up with Sublime.  I'm going to right click, select Open With, and then choose Sublime.  And we're in Sublime, let's scroll down and look at that.  All the contents from our file are in here now.  Google App Engine created that for  you and made sure everything was set up properly.  Now that we've confirmed that the main.pi file is the same let's go check  out app.yaml.  Great so we're back in the project folder, let's open up app.yaml and  confirm it has everything we're looking for.  I'm going to right click on app.yaml, select Open.  And it looks like Windows can't open this file,  let's select a program from a list of installed programs.  We're going to open it up with Sublime so let's see if we can find it in there.  I'll click OK, and there's sublime.  Let's select it, click OK and there we go.  So, we're in our app.yaml file and  it looks like that we've got everything we need.  Google app engine added in a little bit of additional information,  but really we need to focus on the application ID right here.  Right now the application ID is engine app.  But let's go ahead and paste in our application ID we created before.  Now that we've pasted in our application ID let's go ahead and  save this file and now we want to deploy it.  Let's see if it actually works.  I'm going to go back to Google App Engine Launcher.  I'm going to highlight our application and click deploy.  Okay, let's take a look at our log and yes,  it looks like our deployment was successful.  Let's open it up in the browser, and make sure everything worked out okay.  I'm going to go to our application ID.appsot.com.  Let's reload the page and see what happens.  And look at that, we have Hello world.  Everything worked great.
