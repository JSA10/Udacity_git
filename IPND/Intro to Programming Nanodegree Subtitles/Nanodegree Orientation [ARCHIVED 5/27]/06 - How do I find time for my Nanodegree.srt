The single biggest contributor to[br]student success in the Nanodegree

0:00:03.420,0:00:04.980
is time commitment.

0:00:04.980,0:00:07.400
The first graduate of any[br]Nanodegree at Udacity

0:00:07.400,0:00:09.280
didn't have any prior experience.

0:00:09.280,0:00:12.120
He simply worked hard and[br]put in time consistently,

0:00:12.120,0:00:14.480
making his Nanodegree part of[br]his daily and weekly schedule.

0:00:14.480,0:00:18.240
Now as I mentioned before,[br]the timeline you're operating on,

0:00:18.240,0:00:21.810
it seems that you'll work on your[br]Nanodegree for ten hours a week.

0:00:21.810,0:00:24.380
Since many students have a lot of[br]other things going on in their lives,

0:00:24.380,0:00:28.340
like jobs, families, or other big[br]commitments, it's really important to

0:00:28.340,0:00:31.980
block out time on your calendar[br]every week for your Nanodegree.

0:00:31.980,0:00:33.290
While binge learning works well for

0:00:33.290,0:00:36.880
some people, the most successful Udacity[br]students work on their courses and

0:00:36.880,0:00:40.160
projects multiple times a week,[br]not just in one big chunk.

0:00:40.160,0:00:42.220
And really,[br]a ten hour chunk would be exhausting.

0:00:43.230,0:00:45.290
This helps the learning[br]you're doing stick better,

0:00:45.290,0:00:46.830
since you're thinking[br]about it more frequently.

0:00:47.840,0:00:50.600
On top of that, having a regular[br]weekly routine that you stick to

0:00:50.600,0:00:53.430
is really helpful for[br]keeping up your dedication.

0:00:53.430,0:00:56.620
Working at about the same time slots[br]each week can be really helpful.

0:00:56.620,0:00:59.770
After you do it for a few weeks,[br]it'll just feel like second nature.

0:00:59.770,0:01:01.560
So go into your calendar right now, and

0:01:01.560,0:01:04.739
mark out which times you'll work on[br]the Nanodegree this week and next week.
