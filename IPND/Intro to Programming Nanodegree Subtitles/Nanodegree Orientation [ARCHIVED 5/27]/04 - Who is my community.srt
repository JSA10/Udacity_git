Another very important part of your[br]Nanodegree experience is that you're

0:00:03.390,0:00:04.800
part of a Cohort.

0:00:04.800,0:00:07.740
This is basically a group of students[br]who are starting the program with you

0:00:07.740,0:00:09.080
and will stay with you[br]until the very end.

0:00:09.080,0:00:11.920
They'll be your community for[br]the whole time you're in the program.

0:00:11.920,0:00:15.120
And you'll be working on the same[br]timeline for your projects.

0:00:15.120,0:00:17.660
You'll interact with each other almost[br]everyday throughout the program, so

0:00:17.660,0:00:19.480
we highly recommend getting to[br]know each other right away.

0:00:20.595,0:00:23.400
Your community will share a forum,[br]which is the first place you should go

0:00:23.400,0:00:26.170
whenever you need to get help or[br]have questions.

0:00:26.170,0:00:28.760
It's important to get to know these[br]people because they'll be your support

0:00:28.760,0:00:32.330
network now and the start of your[br]professional network in the future.

0:00:32.330,0:00:34.520
We hope you stay in touch with each[br]other after you graduate as well.

0:00:35.980,0:00:37.830
The Cohort you're part of at[br]the beginning of the program

0:00:37.830,0:00:39.200
is based on the month[br]that you're starting.
