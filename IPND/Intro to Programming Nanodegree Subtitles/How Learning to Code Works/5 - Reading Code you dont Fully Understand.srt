Awareness of these ideas may not seem like much, but it's actually a big deal.  Because with the awareness that you have, you can now look at a substantial  code base like the code that generates this page, and  get a feel for how it works.  You won't understand everything, but a lot of it will look familiar.  So, let's go through the code that generated this page and see what I mean.  I've already shown you the web page that you'll be able to make when your done  with this nanodegree.  But now I want to show you the code you'll write  that will generate a page like this.  So, if I find the folder in my computer that has all this code,  it's this one intro programming nda, I've called it.  And notice it's got a lot in it, this is what happens when you write larger  programs, you can't fit all of your code in a single file.  In fact, we have folders with different sorts of files and more and more files,  and they're all of different types, .py, .yaml, .css, .jpg, .html.  But as you can see, the majority of the files are HTML files,  which is what you've already started to learn.  For example, this file is called adsubmission.html.  And it's responsible for  the page you'll see when you submit your project at the end of this Nanodegree.  That's this page.  So notice that this page has a nice heading at the top.  That heading has a description when you complete the final project.  And then we have some more things down here.  We have what looks like some sort of form where we can add some input.  These forms seem to have some labels, and  then way at the bottom we have this button which will submit the project.  So let's see what the code looks like, that generated this page.  so, to open this, I'm going to right click > Open with > Sublime Text,  which is a program you're going to be downloading shortly, and  this is what I see.  Now first, I want to point out there's going to be a lot of code in here that  you don't understand yet.  That's to be expected, you're just starting.  For example, this looks a little weird and these class equals title,  class equals section, class equals description, also look weird.  Though maybe you can begin to guess what they may be doing.  Here we have an h1, that's a header element and  it says degree student projects.  Here is that description we were looking at and down here.  We have something called the form.  Hm, interesting.  Let me zoom out a bit, because if the form begins here, I'm going to look  all the way down to see where it ends, and it ends there, okay.  Let me see what's inside of that.  There appears to be a name to display, a URL, a project description.  And notice that these are all in those b tags that you're familiar with.  There's some other things that you probably don't understand at this point,  but that's all right, we're getting there.  And then at the end we have this end block, and even if you don't know  what that means quite yet, it seems to have something to do with this.  Now, this process I just went through was me trying to demonstrate what I  actually do when I look at code I don't understand.  And that happens all the time.  I try and anchor onto the things I do understand and build from there.  Now, if I wanted to, I could look up any of these things I don't know.  So for example, form, what is a form?  I'm going to go to Google and I'm going to type html form.  And the first thing I get, maybe it will help.  The form element, that looks familiar.  It says down here html forms contain form elements.  Form elements are types of input elements, check boxes, radio buttons.  Okay, this seems about right.  And I could keep reading, I could learn more.  Right now, I'm not going to do that.  But Google is really a huge friend in looking up and  researching what's going on with code you don't understand.  I wanted to show you this process of encountering new code and  looking into Google for what it does,  because it's a totally authentic part of every programmer's workflow.  There's a lot to learn out there, and you're never going to learn it all.  And so, looking up things as you need them is a totally normal thing to do.  Anyways, just as a reminder, you're about to take your boring black and  white page, and turn it into something beautiful and colorful.  So good luck, and have fun.
