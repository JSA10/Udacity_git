Learning to code is hard and

0:00:03.660,0:00:05.520
you will feel confusion and[br]you will feel frustration.

0:00:05.520,0:00:08.920
But that is okay, that's to be expected.

0:00:08.920,0:00:11.989
What isn't okay is[br]when these confusion or

0:00:11.989,0:00:17.447
frustration is allowed to turn into[br]something worse like disappointment,

0:00:17.447,0:00:22.080
or anger, or terror, or[br]whatever, whatever that guy is.

0:00:22.080,0:00:23.800
Certainly doesn't look happy.

0:00:23.800,0:00:27.470
And since you're watching this right[br]now, you want to learn to code.

0:00:27.470,0:00:30.420
But if you start feeling[br]anything like this,

0:00:30.420,0:00:32.400
you're probably going to want to quit.

0:00:32.400,0:00:37.130
So, you should try your best to[br]avoid letting this, turn into this.

0:00:37.130,0:00:40.590
So, let me tell you some strategies for[br]how to stick with it.

0:00:40.590,0:00:41.670
When you start feeling frustrated or

0:00:41.670,0:00:44.030
confused, there are a few[br]things you can do.

0:00:44.030,0:00:46.180
First, you should always ask for help.

0:00:47.200,0:00:51.930
Typing your problem into a Google[br]search bar, will often solve it.

0:00:51.930,0:00:54.950
And, you can also go to[br]the Udacity discussion forums.

0:00:54.950,0:00:56.690
Your classmates[br]are an incredible resource.

0:00:56.690,0:01:01.130
The second thing you can[br]do is just take a break.

0:01:01.130,0:01:02.610
Press that pause button.

0:01:02.610,0:01:06.010
Try to learn when you're frustrated[br]can be really counterproductive.

0:01:06.010,0:01:08.700
Don't hesitate to stop and[br]come back the next day.

0:01:08.700,0:01:11.970
The third thing you can do, and this is[br]something a lot of people have trouble

0:01:11.970,0:01:16.950
with, but which is really useful,[br]is you can just keep going.

0:01:16.950,0:01:18.540
Look at answers when they're available.

0:01:18.540,0:01:19.690
Try to learn from them.

0:01:19.690,0:01:21.720
Go on without them if they're not.

0:01:21.720,0:01:25.040
Remember, you are not meant to be an[br]expert in this nanodegree, so sometimes

0:01:25.040,0:01:29.730
the best move will be to just go on and[br]accept a little temporary confusion.

0:01:29.730,0:01:31.912
To help you know when you should[br]feel comfortable continuing,

0:01:31.912,0:01:35.970
I'm going to occasionally be asking you[br]to rate yourself on the spectrum of

0:01:35.970,0:01:38.770
expertise from ignorance to fluency.

0:01:38.770,0:01:39.830
And then based on your responses,

0:01:39.830,0:01:43.020
I'm going to give you feedback[br]about what you should do next.

0:01:43.020,0:01:43.920
Let's try that out right now.
