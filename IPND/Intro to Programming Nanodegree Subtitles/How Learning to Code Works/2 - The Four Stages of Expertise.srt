0:00:00.000,0:00:04.759
So, it actually winds up being helpful[br]to think of this continuum from novice

0:00:04.759,0:00:07.408
to expert as having[br]four distinct stages.

0:00:07.408,0:00:11.150
And I'm going to be referring to these[br]four stages throughout the NIM degree,

0:00:11.150,0:00:14.730
so you know to what extent you should[br]be mastering the material we cover.

0:00:15.770,0:00:18.219
In order to talk about these stages,[br]let's give them names.

0:00:18.219,0:00:22.464
On this end, I'm going to replace I[br]don't even know where to begin with

0:00:22.464,0:00:25.610
a title and that word is ignorance.

0:00:25.610,0:00:29.096
Now, ignorance sounds harsh,[br]but it isn't meant that way.

0:00:29.096,0:00:31.771
Ignorance about something just[br]means you just don't know yet

0:00:31.771,0:00:34.703
it exists and this is how every[br]journey towards expertise begins and

0:00:34.703,0:00:37.390
that's why we're calling it stage zero.

0:00:37.390,0:00:42.743
On the other end, let's replace why was[br]this ever hard with the word fluency.

0:00:42.743,0:00:47.730
Because when you're really fluent in[br]something, you've truly mastered it.

0:00:47.730,0:00:50.751
In between these two extremes,[br]there are two important stages.

0:00:50.751,0:00:55.589
First, comes awareness and[br]that is followed by ability.

0:00:55.589,0:00:57.282
To better explain what[br]these stages mean,

0:00:57.282,0:00:59.960
I'm going to share[br]a personal example with you.

0:00:59.960,0:01:02.568
As I do, try to connect[br]the stages I went through to

0:01:02.568,0:01:05.066
the example you just came up with for[br]yourself.

0:01:05.066,0:01:09.630
And the example I want to share is how[br]I learned to drive a stick shift car.

0:01:09.630,0:01:11.238
Because when I was a little kid,

0:01:11.238,0:01:15.242
I actually didn't know that different[br]cars could be driven in different ways.

0:01:15.242,0:01:16.790
I had no idea what stick shift was.

0:01:16.790,0:01:19.180
I was ignorant of its existence.

0:01:19.180,0:01:20.245
And then one day,

0:01:20.245,0:01:24.151
I asked my dad why he kept moving[br]the shifter around when he drove.

0:01:24.151,0:01:27.844
And he explained to me manual[br]transmissions and pretty quickly,

0:01:27.844,0:01:31.010
I at least had an awareness[br]that stick shift was a thing.

0:01:32.100,0:01:34.172
And even though that seems small,

0:01:34.172,0:01:38.399
this was an essential stage in my[br]journey towards becoming an expert.

0:01:38.399,0:01:42.636
The transition to this next[br]stage began on my 16th birthday.

0:01:42.636,0:01:45.573
I had gotten my driver's license and[br]I really wanted to drive.

0:01:45.573,0:01:48.040
So, I needed to learn[br]how to drive stick.

0:01:48.040,0:01:51.738
My dad gave me some lessons and[br]within just one or two of these lessons,

0:01:51.738,0:01:53.380
I could actually drive stick.

0:01:53.380,0:01:56.150
It was really hard, but[br]I was still driving.

0:01:56.150,0:01:59.235
I had to be very focused on what[br]I was doing with the clutch and

0:01:59.235,0:02:02.523
the break and the shifter and[br]the gas, but I can make the car go.

0:02:02.523,0:02:04.620
It was a big achievement.

0:02:04.620,0:02:07.428
And now, I've gotten to fluency.

0:02:07.428,0:02:09.630
When I drive,[br]I forget what I'm even doing.

0:02:09.630,0:02:13.483
I don't even think about driving[br]a stick, it just comes natural and

0:02:13.483,0:02:14.720
that's fine.

0:02:14.720,0:02:19.008
But let's talk about the most[br]empowering part of these stages.

0:02:19.008,0:02:23.315
To get from ignorance to awareness[br]took me a matter of minutes.

0:02:23.315,0:02:27.047
All my dad had to do was explain[br]to me that this thing existed.

0:02:27.047,0:02:31.895
Then to get from awareness to ability,[br]only took a matter of days.

0:02:31.895,0:02:34.720
And even though I was far[br]from being an expert,

0:02:34.720,0:02:38.859
after those two days of instruction[br]practice, I was driving a car.

0:02:38.859,0:02:39.810
It felt very cool.

0:02:40.910,0:02:46.267
Now getting from ability to fluency,[br]that required years of practice.

0:02:46.267,0:02:49.517
And I was constantly getting[br]closer to fluency over that time,

0:02:49.517,0:02:53.134
but it wasn't until a couple of years[br]of practice that I was actually at

0:02:53.134,0:02:56.470
the stage where I wasn't thinking[br]at all about what I was doing.

0:02:57.530,0:03:00.981
So think back to your example[br]of expertise that you have.

0:03:00.981,0:03:03.880
How did you make these transitions?

0:03:03.880,0:03:05.387
How long did each take?

0:03:05.387,0:03:08.923
If you'd like, feel free to share[br]your story on the discussion forum.

0:03:08.923,0:03:11.970
In the next video, I'm going to[br]explain why these stages are so

0:03:11.970,0:03:15.940
relevant to the educational journey to[br]learn to code that you are on right now.
