So Cameron, I think a lot of the students who are taking the intro to  programming m degree may be wondering why they should  begin their journeys as programmers with this course which we designed for  somebody who is specifically looking to be a front-end web developer.   And first off,  I want to say that front-end web development is just a lot of fun.  So I think it's a great place to start off.  But it's also one of the few areas of programming that is just  inherently visual.  Which means that anything you do, any code you write,  any changes you make, will automatically be visible inside a browsers.  And, for instance, later on in the course you'll be learning Python.  And Python's great, but if you want to show off Python, you're going to have to  show it to somebody who knows what that code does because  otherwise it's just going to look like a jumble of letters, numbers, and symbols.  But with web development, it's really easy to share a website with somebody.  So it's a fantastic place to not just get immediate feedback on the code that  you're writing, but also give you a chance to share what you're doing.   Front-end web development is really fun.  Lots of immediate, early rewards.  Cameron, can you talk a little bit about what the students are about to see in  the very next video?   in the next video you'll be learning about the purposes of HTML,  CSS, and JavaScript which are the three languages that go into web development.  And don't worry.  You might hear some terms you aren't quite familiar with.  But really what you need to take away is that HTML, CSS, and  JavaScript have different purposes when you're developing a website.  And really for this course, for  this next part of the Nanodegree all you need to worry about are HTML and CSS.  Script in this Nanodegree, but what you  should take away is that awareness that we were talking about earlier.  Knowing that Java Script exists, means you know what to search for  if you decide to pursue front-end web development in the future.
