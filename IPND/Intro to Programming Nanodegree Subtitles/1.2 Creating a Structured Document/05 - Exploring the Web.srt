As an example, let's take a look at Wikipedia.

0:00:03.530,0:00:06.870
As you can see, there is a lot on this page.

0:00:06.870,0:00:11.140
There's text and lots of different images of different sizes and

0:00:11.140,0:00:15.350
shapes, but let's take a look at the inner structure of the site.

0:00:15.350,0:00:17.280
I'm using Google Chrome as my browser,

0:00:17.280,0:00:20.140
which includes really great Developer tools.

0:00:20.140,0:00:22.110
And you should be sure to follow along with me.

0:00:22.110,0:00:25.960
In Google Chrome, if you select this three-line icon at the upper right of your

0:00:25.960,0:00:32.110
screen and select Tools > Developer Tools,

0:00:32.110,0:00:36.080
an additional panel will open at the bottom of the browser.

0:00:36.080,0:00:39.030
This shows you the structure of the page.

0:00:39.030,0:00:41.280
And this is a really important fact to know.

0:00:41.280,0:00:45.440
What you see here is not the actual code itself but

0:00:45.440,0:00:49.520
rather the structure of the page as the browser interprets it.

0:00:49.520,0:00:51.400
If you mouse over the lines or

0:00:51.400,0:00:56.110
elements in the structure, you'll notice that parts of the page get highlighted.

0:00:56.110,0:01:00.440
If you click on the triangle to the left of a line, it expands.

0:01:00.440,0:01:05.489
And you can keep going deeper and deeper into this tree-like structure.

0:01:05.489,0:01:11.040
There is also a separate panel on the right side, which is called Styles.

0:01:11.040,0:01:14.270
And this contains a different type of information.

0:01:14.270,0:01:18.440
Go ahead and explore the site on your own and as you're exploring see what

0:01:18.440,0:01:21.760
observations you can make about the Wikipedia page and structure.

0:01:22.770,0:01:26.660
And when you're done, which of the following statements did you find true?

0:01:26.660,0:01:30.470
Are all elements of the structure visible on the page?

0:01:30.470,0:01:33.970
Are all highlighted elements rectangular?

0:01:33.970,0:01:36.620
Or, if you go deep enough in the structure,

0:01:36.620,0:01:38.990
can you read the same text as you see on the page?
