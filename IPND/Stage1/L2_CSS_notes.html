CSS: Cascading Style Sheets
  - named as they contain information that shapes the style of a page and come from separate sheets that can be structured in a cascading manner
  - similar to a tree structure but specifications within one can be applied to all or focused to specific sections

CSS style sheet added explicitly within the html header:
  <!-- <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" text=CSS> -->

Within CSS the coding structure is "attribute:choice;" e.g. color:red;
  Syntax: enclose within { }
          can focus to a specific section with its identifier e.g. h2 or class attribute
          e.g. for a div section that was called <div class = description>, the CSS code to style just that section would be
              .description {
                color: red;
              }
