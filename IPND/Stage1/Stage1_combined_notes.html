          <ul>
          <li>The WWW consists of html documents (Hyper Text Markup Language)</li>
          <li>These are connected to each other using links (URLs)</li>
          <li>HTML documents can contain a variety of content types: e.g. text, images, music or video.</li>

      <h2> How does the internet work? </h2>
        <p> Imagine three separate stages in a process, starting with a person on a laptop on the left
            and ending with giant servers that store all the html coded content previously discussed.
            The internet is the glue in the middle that enables web browsers on people's laptops to connect with and find content stored on these servers.
            Content is created and structured using html and url link identifiers enable location. A technology called <strong>"Hyper Text Transfer Protocol" (HTTP) enables the internet to communicate with the servers.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            HTTP forms the connection with servers, allowing individual web browsers to find and translate the files stored on them into
            content that can be displayed for and used by people.

      <h2> Understanding HTML </h2>
        <p>
            <h3>HTML is made up of four elements: </h3>
              <ol><li>Text content (that you see on a web page)</li><br>
              <li>Markups (code that determines what it looks like)</li><br>
              <li>References to other documents (images / videos)</li><br>
              <li>Links to other pages</li>
              </ol>
        </p>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="">
      <p>
      <h3>HTML tags:</h3>
        <p> <b>Structure:</b> Tags consist of an opening tag, followed by visible content, closed with a matching second tag <br>
            Each pair of opening and closing tags can be thought of as an <em> element. </em>

            <b>Attributes:</b> Tags can have attributes, a common example is the anchor tag, which can be assigned links.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Void Tags:</b> Image tags are examples of void tags. Void tags have no text 'content' so don't
            need closing tag. NOTE: Image tags contain two attributes: A URL link to actual image,
            plus an alternative message in case image doesn't load, or as a marker for the blind. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Whitespace:</b> Multiple lines in html code will make no difference to output as all whitespace
            is ignored (but for a single standard space in the text).
            Use break to insert a break (another void tag). Can also use the paragraph tag. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Inline vs. Block:</b> HTML code can work inline, within the text itself e.g. break, emphasis or image <br>
              Or it can effectively place a wrapper around a block of content e.g. paragraph.  <br>
            <br>
            <b>Container tags:</b> These are tags that don't do anything themselves but contain content and attributes.
            Examples are span tag (inline) or div tag (block). Both can have attributes added to them, like css code to change style and design.

      <h2>HTML, CSS & Javascript are building blocks of websites</h2>
      <p>
        <b>Think of a website as a house: </b>
        <p>
        <strong>HTML is the structure</strong> - where the walls are, how many rooms etc.
        CSS is the style - the colours of the walls, what wallpaper or flooring there is
        Javascript is the interactive elements that can change things within your house - e.g. tv remote, garage door opener - cha

      <h2>Inspecting live html with web inspectors</h2>
      <p>
        <b>When exploring a wikipedia page using developer tools we can observe that:</b>
        <ol>
        <li>All html is rectangular</li>
        <li>We can drill down to specific text that has displayed on the page</li>
        <li>By using the style panes we can drill down to font sizes and types, border sizes etc.</li>
        <! -- (To access style section: visible on chrome dev tool, in the far right icon in safari web inspector) --!>

    <div class="tree structure">
      <h2>HTML follows a tree like structure</h2>
        - with each new 'branch' nested within the previous one
        - can use the parent, child analogy too
        - we mapped out a very simple one
    </div>
    <div class="HTML & CSS">
      <h2>HTML-CSS-DOM</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>HTML and CSS are both "languages"</li>
        <li>HTML controls the "structure" of a web page</li>
        <li>CSS controls the "style" of a page (how it looks).</li>
        <li>When programmers talk about the "DOM" (Document Object Model) they are
        talking about the tree-like structure of a page.</li>
      </ol>
    <p>
    </p>
      HTML is the language of the web, with set syntax and rules
      html uses tags to form elements, to form a tree structure that the browser can display

      CSS also follows syntax and rules.
      CSS used within the struture of html tags to define style

        <strong>Start with a plan, then build structure:</strong>
        <ol>
          <li>Get the paper out - start drawing key points and structure on paper, much like an essay or project plan</li>
          <li>Split the paper page into boxes and annotate what goes into them</li>
          <li>When get to setting out in html use container tags e.g. &lt;div class = ""&gt;placeholder&lt;/div&gt;</li>
          <li {margin-left: 40px;}>The class attribute is metadata describing what this container or box holds</li>
