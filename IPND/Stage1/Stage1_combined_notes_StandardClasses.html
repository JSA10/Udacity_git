      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          First, a little bit about my motivations for taking on this course. I am on a mission to build a Data Science skillset
          as I believe the ability to make sense of all types of data will be a powerful and future proof skillset professionally
          and enable me to make better decisions personally. I work as a data analyst in a digital agency (we make websites, experiences and content)
          and have a reasonable background in statistics and maths, so the programming side is the one which needs solid foundations.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've been exploring a variety of online MOOCs, books and face to face learning options but have recently found some of the Udacity
          courses on Statistics the best options for teaching a potentially dry subject in an engaging and memorable way. For programming
          skills learning by doing has to be the primary focus and ultimately it just seems that Udacity, with it's strong links to the biggest
          tech companies is potentially in a place to deliver the most practical and innovative syllabus, compared to say an academic Data Science program.
          So taking the IPND is also a tester before committing to a more involved nanodegree program like the Data Analyst or Machine Learning Engineer ones.
        </p>
        <p>
          This guy has done a lot of thinking on the subject of traditional masters vs. Udacity Nanodegree which I agree with, if at all
          interested in the data route I highly recommend reading some of his posts.
        </p>
        I work as a data analyst in a Digital Agency
        (we build websites and create content for brands) and have been on a mission to upskill over the last couple of years.
        Recently I've been focused on Statistics, Programming and Data Science, where the two meet. Primarily with R but have
        used Python as a way to understand the basics of programming and explored a few other fields, tools and languages.
        From a resource point of view I've tried a variety of online MOOCs, books and some face to face training.
        While I have definitely made progress I feel as if the programming side, as it was a completely new skill still needs to

            <p>
              <b>Structure:</b> Tags consist of an opening tag, followed by visible content, closed with a matching second tag.
                Each pair of opening and closing tags can be thought of as an <em> element. </em>
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Attributes:</b> Tags can have attributes, a common example is the anchor tag, which can be assigned links.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Attributes:</b> Tags can have attributes, a common example is the anchor tag, which can be assigned links.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Void Tags:</b> Image tags are examples of void tags. Void tags have no text 'content' so don't
              need closing tag. NOTE: Image tags contain two attributes: A URL link to actual image,
              plus an alternative message in case image doesn't load, or as a marker for the blind.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Whitespace:</b> Multiple lines in html code will make no difference to output as all whitespace
              is ignored (but for a single standard space in the text).
              Use break to insert a break (another void tag). Can also use the paragraph tag.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Inline vs. Block:</b> HTML code can work inline, within the text itself e.g. break, emphasis or image.
                Or it can effectively place a wrapper around a block of content e.g. paragraph.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Container tags:</b> These are tags that don't do anything themselves but contain content and attributes.
              Examples are span tag (inline) or div tag (block). Both can have attributes added to them, like css code to change style and design.
            </p>

              <p>
                What is CSS?
                CSS is code written to control the "style" of HTML elements.
              </p>
              <p>
                How does CSS "control" HTML?
                If you want to write CSS that makes all h1 elements have a black background and white text, you would write:
              </p>
              <p>
                h1 {
                  background-color : black;
                  color: white;
                }
              </p>

              <p>
                In this example, the h1 is a selector. It says to the browser "I want you to apply the rules I'm about to tell you to every h1 element."

                The line of code that says background-color : black; is a declaration. background-color is a property and black is the value of that property.
              </p>
              <p>
                To write a comment for other readers of your code, you'd write:

                /* This is a CSS comment.*/
              </p>

          <b>CSS:</b> Cascading Style Sheets. Named as they are made up of sheets that shape the style of a page and can be structured in a cascading manner.
          Imagine a tree structure, but key difference is specifications within one can be applied to all, or focused to specific sections.

          <b>Style:</b> This word can refer to many things and so it can be confusing. It can refer to:

            The HTML element. For example: <style>div {color:blue}</style>
            The HTML attribute. For example: <div style="color : blue">this text would be blue</div>
            The general look of a web page. For example: "I like that site's style."
            A verb. For example: "I'm making progress on my page. The structure is all done but now I have to style it."

          <b>Rule:</b> a line of CSS code describing the value that a certain attribute should take.

          <b>Property:</b> The property you want to change.

          <b>Value:</b> The value that you want to assign to the attribute.

          <b>Selector:</b> The name that you use in order to target the elements that are assigned to a class or id attribute in the HTML.

          <b>Class:</b> A class refers to a group of elements that can be styled together. Class names should not contain periods or any other punctuation marks such as class="1.1"

          <b>ID:</b> ID's are unique identifiers that uniquely identifies an element in HTML.

            <h3>Three approaches to adding CSS to your html document</h3>
          </div>
          <div class="concept_description">
            <p>
              <strong>Method 1: include CSS in the head of your html</strong>
                <br>+ Good for small projects
                <br>- Would lead to repetition for many pages
                <br><b>Example:</b> My stage0 project
            </p>
            <p>
              Include code example
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Method 2: Link html to separate CSS file</strong>
              + Helps you stay organised
              - is still an extra step
              Example: Working example in lesson 2: My Favourite App

           </p>
           <p>
              Include code example
                See example above - essentially need to add a link tag within the header
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>Method 3: Write CSS inline with your HTML</strong>
            <br>- leads to LOTS of repeated code
            <br>+ just need to be familiar with this method as may well see other code that uses this method
           </p>


        </div>
        </div>
            '''
            <div class="">

            </div>
            '''
        <div class="concept">
            Everything is boxes

              So box size calculations are important
              However, box size doesn't just include the content itself, but also three outer layers
                padding
                border
                margin

              You can specify size of individual elements and you can also ensure that all parts are included in the calculation to help with scaling using the following code:

                *{
                  box-sizing: border-box;
                  }

                Note - this is a new feature so need to ensure it works across browsers by specifying them in advance
                - Do this by referencing:
                  webkit (safari)
                  moz
                  ms
                    Complete code would be
                      *{
                      -webkit-box-sizing: border-box;
                      -moz-box-sizing: border-box;
                      -ms-box-sizing: border-box;
                      box-sizing: border-box;
                      }

                Scaling: Using pixels to size boxes means that the parameters will never change, which could lead to a bad user experience as screen sizes change.
                Can also use a % figure which will evolve.

            Throughout this lesson we have been following a simple process of Code-Test-Refine

              - Start with structure of page
              - Map the design - visually boxify
              - Add html tags to replicate structure
              - Size the boxes throughout the

            When translating a design use a 5 step process:
            1 - Look for natural boxes
            2 - Look for repeated styles and semantic elements (e.g. H2s)
            3 - Write your HTML
            4 - Apply styles
            5 - Fix things

            During the process, repeat steps 3 and 4 until code replicates the design exactly
