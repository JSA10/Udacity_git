PART 3
DUEJUL 11
Project Submission
In this stage, you'll use a computer language called HTML and CSS and notes about the new concepts and skills you've learned so far to make your web page look professional!

Ready to submit? Follow these instructions!

Code Review
Your reviewer will look at the code you've written and provide feedback on:

Use of Syntax: All of your HTML and CSS should be properly formatted and should pass HTML validation and CSS validation tests.

IMPORTANT: Please read the Instructor Notes below for further instructions on HTML validation.

Use of Logical HTML Structure: Content that is logically related should be grouped together within a container element (like a <div> or <span>). Additionally, all tags should be used for their semantic purpose (ex: don't use a <p> tag to make a headline).
Use of HTML Classes and CSS Styling: There shouldn't be any unnecessary repetition in your CSS code. Similar HTML elements should have the same class name.

IMPORTANT: You MUST include a CSS file in your project submissions. We want you to practice linking CSS in your HTML. Simply using <style> tags is not sufficient enough to demonstrate your knowledge of linking CSS to your HTML file.
The rubric that will be used is included below. If you cannot see the image below, go to the project rubrics page here.
