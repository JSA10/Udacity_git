      <h2>HTML, CSS & Javascript are building blocks of websites</h2>
      <p>
        <b>Think of a website as a house: </b>
        <p>
        <strong>HTML is the structure</strong> - where the walls are, how many rooms etc.
        CSS is the style - the colours of the walls, what wallpaper or flooring there is
        Javascript is the interactive elements that can change things within your house - e.g. tv remote, garage door opener - cha

      <h2>Inspecting live html with web inspectors</h2>
      <p>
        <b>When exploring a wikipedia page using developer tools we can observe that:</b>
        <ol>
        <li>All html is rectangular</li>
        <li>We can drill down to specific text that has displayed on the page</li>
        <li>By using the style panes we can drill down to font sizes and types, border sizes etc.</li>
        <! -- (To access style section: visible on chrome dev tool, in the far right icon in safari web inspector) --!>

    <div class="tree structure">
  HTML follows a tree like structure, with each new 'branch' nested within the previous one
  - can use the parent, child analogy too
  - we mapped out a very simple one

    <div class="HTML & CSS">
  Key takeaways from HTML-CSS-DOM video

  HTML and CSS are both "languages"
  HTML controls the "structure" of a web page
  CSS controls the "style" of a page (how it looks).
  When programmers talk about the "DOM" (Document Object Model) they are
  talking about the tree-like structure of a page.


  HTML is the language of the web, with set syntax and rules
    html uses tags to form elements, to form a tree structure that the browser can display

  CSS also follows syntax and rules.
    CSS used within the struture of html tags to define style

    <div class="boxifying design">

  Everything in html is boxes. There are a huge variety of ways these boxes can be manipulated to
  build very 'unboxlike' things but need to understand that basic principle and the need to
  'boxify' design

  Tips: Plan out structure on paper to start, split the page into boxes and annotate what goes into them
  (much like process to planning out a essay or deck or project)
    When get to setting out in html use container tags <div class=""> placeholder </div>
    The class attribute is metadata describing what this container holds or it's purpose (much like labels on moving boxes)
