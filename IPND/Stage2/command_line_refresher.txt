CLI Refresher

pwd  #Print the location of the current directory (or working directory)
ls
open  #mac command to open file
cd  #save time by chaining folders e.g. docs/ud/ipnd
cd ..
mkdir <newfolder> OR currentfolder/newfolder
touch new_file.txt OR currentfolder/newfile.txt
rm <filename>  #note this deletes completely - skips trash bin
rm file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
rmdir <directory_name>  #Only works on empty directories
rm -rf  # ••••• BE VERY CAREFUL WITH THIS REMOVE WITH FORCE COMMAND
# rf stands for recursive force and is used to delete directory + all files and folders
# It doesn't ask for confirmation and you can't retrieve items from trash

Udacity recommend running Python code in command line as cleanest and easiest way to do so
Process: Write code in text editor saved as .py, navigate to folder using above commands and type

python <name_of_file.py>
