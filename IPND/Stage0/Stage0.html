<em> HTML is <b>reasonably straightforward</b></em>

tags can have attributes <tag attr = "value"> content </tag>

This website is <a href = "https://www.udacity.com">my favorite</a>

image tags are examples of void tags. Void tags have no text 'content' so don't
need closing tag

<img src = "url" alt = "text">
#src is the image itself (content contained within the tag)
#alt is text to display if image doesn't. Recommended to always use as message
for broken links / requests and to help blind people

multiple lines in html code will make no difference to output as all whitespace
is ignored.
Use <br> to insert a break (another void tag)
Can also use paragraph tag <p> content </P>

Hello everyone! <br> We're using two lines now!
Hello everyone! <p> We're using two lines now! </p>

Why have more than one way to create a new line?
# both are examples of two different types of html code -
inline <br> <em> <img>
vs. block <p>
# Essentially inline works within the text itself and inserts amends
# Where block actually puts a wrapper around the portion of text selected

Container tags - these are tags that don't do anything themselves but contain
content and attributes. E.G.
<span> </span> (inline)
<div> </div> (block)
both can have attributes added to them, like css code to change style and design
<span class = "foo"> text </span>
<div class = "bar"> text </span>

a, span, br, img, and strong are all inline elements
while div, p, and form are block elements.
