  <h2 style="font-size:200%;"> <b> World Wide Web (WWW): A web of html documents </b> </h2>
  <p> The WWW consists of html documents (Hyper Text Markup Language)<br>
      These are connected to each other using links (URLs)<br>
      They can contain a variety of content types: e.g. text, images, music or video.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h2> <b> How is the web run? </b> </h2>
  <br>
  <p> If we imagine three separate stages in a process, starting with a person on a laptop on the left
      and ending with giant servers that store all the html coded content previously discussed.<br>
      The web is the glue in the middle that enables web browsers on people's laptops to find content stored on these servers. <br>
      It does so using html code and url link identifiers but also a technology called "Hyper Text Transfer Protocol" (HTTP).<br>
      HTTP forms the connection with servers, allowing individual web browsers to find and translate the files stored on them into
      content that can be displayed for and used by people.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h2 style="font-size:200%;"> <b> Diving into HTML </b> </h2>
  <br>
  <p>
      <b>HTML is made up of four elements: </b><br>
      <br>
      <em> Text content (that you see on a web page)<br>
      Markups (code that determines what it looks like)<br>
      References to other documents (images / videos)<br>
      Links to other pages </em> <br>
  </p>
  <p> <b>Structure:</b> Tags consist of an opening tag "<NAME>", followed by visible content, closed with a matching second tag "</NAME>" <br>
      Each pair of opening and closing tag can be thought of as an <em> element </em> <br>
      <br>
      <b>Attributes:</b> Tags can have attributes, a common example is the anchor tag, which can be assigned links.
      <br>
      <b>Void Tags:</b> Image tags are examples of void tags. Void tags have no text 'content' so don't
      need closing tag. Image tags contain two attributes: A URL link to actual image,
      plus an alternative message in case image doesn't load, or as a marker for the blind. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Whitespace:</b> Multiple lines in html code will make no difference to output as all whitespace
      is ignored (but for a single standard space in the text).<br>
      Use "<br>" to insert a break (another void tag)<br>
      Can also use the paragraph tag "<p> content </P>"<br>
      <br>
      <b>Inline vs. Block:</b> HTML code can work inline, within the text itself e.g. break, emphasis or image <br>
        Or if can effectively place a wrapper around a block of content e.g. paragraph  <br>
      <br>
      Container tags: These are tags that don't do anything themselves but contain content and attributes.<br>
      E.G.
      "<span> </span>" (inline)
      <div> </div> (block)
      both can have attributes added to them, like css code to change style and design
      <span class = "foo"> text </span>
      <div class = "bar"> text </span>

      <b>Inline:</b> a, span, br, img, and strong are all inline elements
      <b>Block:</b> while div, p, and form are block elements.
      <br>
    </p>
